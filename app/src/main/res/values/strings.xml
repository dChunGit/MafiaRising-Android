In the beginning, the mafia will know who each other are, but they will have no information on any of the other roles. During the night phase, every mafia must agree on one person to try murdering. During the day phase, the mafia will be trying to deceive the non-mafia players by framing other players and drawing suspicion away from the actual mafia.

During the day, the police will use the information gathered to sway public opinion to direct the public eye to the mafia without revealing himself in order to escape the murderous hand of the mafia.</string>
